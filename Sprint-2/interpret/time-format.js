// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
 // three times.
// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// 0
// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
 // 00
// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
//The last call to pad in this program is for remainingSeconds, which is 1.
//The pad function is called on remainingSeconds to ensure it has two digits.

// e) What is the return value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
//When pad(1) is called, num is "1", and padStart(2, "0") will add a leading zero to make it two digits:

//pad(1) returns "01"
//So, the return value of pad for the last call is "01". This is because padStart adds a leading zero to single-digit numbers to make them two digits long.
